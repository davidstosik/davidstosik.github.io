# davidstosik.github.io

Yet another attempt at me keeping a blog, starting by way too much time on the setup, rather than writing...

## Setup

This site is using Jekyll and is built using GitHub Actions.

## Working with this setup

Simply commit to the `main` branch the changes you want to make to the site, then push them to GitHub to trigger the GitHub Action build.
Wait a minute and you should be seeing your new content on https://davidstosik.github.io.
