*Preliminary note: this is an ongoing story, so I'll probably update and correct
this post when I get more information.*

Today's post won't be about coding, but just a story of a scam that managed to raise
more than $150,000 on Indiegogo.

That project's name is [Zambilight][zambilight]. The premise is quite interesting: a complete kit
that uses stickable LEDs controlled by a Raspberry Pi to add to your TV
Ambilight-like back-lighting. The idea is not new, has been subject of multiple
tutorials, forum threads, videos on Youtube, etc. Zambilight is not even the first
one to offer a complete, easy to assemble kit.

The difference is that they're an Indiegogo project, have been featured on
Indiegogo's newsletter, and have an attractive price. Actually, the price offered to
early-bird backers is lower than it would cost one person to buy each parts
separately. At that time, I thought that maybe with bulk prices, plus a rebate to
incent first people to back their project, it would be possible to reach such
prices. For the record, "Super Early Birds" were offered the kit for a mere $49
while it was announced that the product would be sold $100 after the campaign.

I jumped in, backing for a "Duo Zambilight Kit" ($100), when the 100 super early
bird kits were already sold out, on September 6th. I wasn't very careful, didn't do
a full background check, as I thought that Indiegogo + featured in official
newsletter + Paypal + 100s of backers were good enough signs.

Quickly after backing, I starter to have my doubts and to ask questions.

1. Someone on Reddit claimed [[his] LED backlight TV blog post [was] being
ripped off by a guy on Indiegogo][reddit_ripped_off], which was true: the
Indiegogo project page was using his pictures without his consent, and
*Software Enterprise* (the name used on Indiegogo by Zambilight's "creator",
should have been another clue) was quickly asked to remove them and replace them
with his own pictures and videos, which he did.

2. *Software Enterprise* did other scam attempts before this one:
  - [Make your iPhone or iPad app for 25 dollar][indiegogo_iphone_app], which is a
blatant rip-off of an online course on Udemy: [iOS 8 and Swift - How to Make a
"Freaking" iPhone App][udemy_iphone] (compare the paragraphs "An app that..."
and "What makes you a good teacher?" on both pages).
  - [Your own personalised Minifig USB Keychain][indiegogo_lego], which description
is shamelessly copying parts of existing similar services' description (use Google).
For example, the UK company [MinifigsMe][minifigsme]. The Youtube account that
posted the Minifig USB keychain video is also named
"[Minifig Me][youtube minifig me]", and also posted videos about Zambilight.
  - A third one which was basically shut down by Indiegogo, as it was trying to
sell an existing product that anyone can buy on the Internet:
[iPhone Projector and battery case in one][indiegogo_projector]. Here is an [article
talking about it][neurdings iphone], and the [product sold on
Amazon][amazon projector]. This one is the proof that Indiegogo was aware of
*Softare Enterprise*'s doings, but didn't care enough to take the backers'
questions about Zambilight more seriously.

3. The deeper I got digging, asking questions, the shadier their technical
descriptions of the product, and solutions to apparent problems got. I'll take for
example the way they were claiming it should work with a TV's internal tuner. It
took me about 10 days to get them admit that it was based on the TV having a SCART
Video output, which is really not a granted thing, especially outside of Europe.

4. When I got too annoying, they offered me, and a few other questioning people, to
become beta-testers, promising us we'd get a kit before anyone else, test it, and
provide feedback. No need to say now that we've never seen those beta kits either.
One backer (apparently German), *Contributor GB*, is claiming they got their own
beta unit, but always failed to provide any picture or video, which makes me believe
they're part of the scam. When *Software Enterprise* announced shipping would start,
we even got the promise that our "beta kit" would ship with our normal perks. What a
joke!

5. When I started to dig and question their organization, timeline, how they were
planning to send dozens of units whereas they hadn't even ordered the different
components from their suppliers, what was the state of the custom case that would
hold the Raspberry Pi, I never got any convincing answer.

6. I could go on and on about the updates becoming more and more flimsy, spaced in
time, and always promising more pictures "next week", "next Friday", etc.

[For the record, I dumped the 6 months of comments left by backers and *Software
Enterprise* on the Indiegogo's project page.](/assets/zambilight/igg-comments.html)

No need to say, I didn't have much trust left in *Software Enterprise*, but I still
had a little hope that they were just a couple of unexperienced people doing this in
their garage after day work, and that although their communication was reall bad,
something would come out of this. At that point, I would even accept to receive the
base components, no documentation, no software, and do the rest myself.

Then they announced, around mid-December, that units would start shipping soon, a
bit late, but not that bad, honestly, so we got to another round of waiting.

We were announced that the first batch had shipped at the end of January, but days after,
*Software Enterprise* failed to give us any list of people they shipped their kit
to, and more than a week after that, nobody was able to tell us they received their
unit, and provide us pictures. Nobody but one. A backer named *Dennis Bakker* on
Indiegogo's website affirmed he received and installed his Zambilight kit, on
February 5th. Hope was somehow reborn! But once more, this person failed providing
any picture of his kit, which makes him one more person I'm suspecting to be part
of the scam (or maybe one more fake account created by *Software Enterprise*).

Then *Software Enterprise* announced that by February 13th, all September backers
would get their units shipped, and even added later that they would post pictures
of the shipped units (that was their last message on Indiegogo's comment page).
One backer who paid for the "reseller kit" (10 units) even got a parcel tracking
number! He was the only one because, you know, tracking option is expensive...
*l4v4l4amp3* (that's his pseudonym on Indiegogo) kept us informed about the
evolution he could see on the tracking page, and had the surprise not to find any
package home after it was stated "delivered" by the shipping company...
Luckily for us, *l4v4l4mp3* didn't give up that easily and started investigating,
asking questions to the post office, and around, in order to find the lost package.
What a surprise when he finally got hold of it, and found inside... a pack of
Pampers diapers!

[![Pampers](/assets/zambilight/pampers_thumb.jpg)](/assets/zambilight/pampers.jpg)

Here's one theory that's running between backers: *l4v4l4mp3* should never have
found that package, which would then have been returned to sender. And we would
still be waiting...

Now we're done believing (took us some time, right?!), and backers are starting to
back off, asking for a refund, either directly, or via Paypal, or their credit card
company. So far, it seems to go well, Paypal seems to be settling claims by
refunding backers (I didn't get mine yet, but I'll update as soon as I do).
When I opened my refund request on Paypal, it even claimed that the seller was not
"able to communicate at the moment", and that my request immediately escalated into
a claim, that Paypal will look into. I think they blocked his account and are now
taking things into hand.

Some people even go directly to *Software Enterprise* to ask for a refund, and it
seems he's refunding them quite quickly. That might be a ruse to keep other people
believing that the project is legit, and that they will get something some day.

Now the last news we got from *Software Enterprise* does not come directly from him.
Apparently, some backers are still in contact with him by email, and he is
saying they received a letter from Philips, asking them not to use the name
"Zambilight", because of similarities, in both the product's purpose, and it's
name, with Philips' trademarked Ambilight.
[The information was apparently also relayed by a Dutch website, claiming they have
Philips' letter in their possession (but not releasing it
publicly).][androidworld zambilight]

[![AndroidNews](/assets/zambilight/androidworld_thumb.jpg)](/assets/zambilight/androidworld.jpg)

This is not really a surprise here, it's even a concern I had back in October,
and asked about:

> You say “create a name”, but aren’t you afraid of lawsuits with a name such
> as Zambilight? Philips’ “Ambilight” is a trademark, and it seems highly
> unlikely they wouldn’t react to a product named Zambilight. (Although, I’m
> talking out of my ass, because I know nothing about trademark laws. :D )

And their answer at that time was:

> Before choosing the name we have contacted The Benelux Office for
> Intellectual Property (BOIP) is the official office for the registration of
> trademarks.

I personally believe that telling us they're having problems with Philips now is
just a way to keep backers on the fence, waiting longer, and get more of them past
Paypal's time limit for opening a claim.

So what's next? Well, a few backers took the things into hand, created a Facebook
group: [Zambilight News on Facebook][fb zambilight news], they are investigating
based on the few hints we have. We have a good idea of *Software Enterprise*'s real
name, as it's provided by Paypal on payment (nothing says it's his real identity,
but I believe Paypal's checks are quite thorough), we have addresses, company names
that might help us bring the thing to the police (a few people apparently already
did, in their respective countries).
It's quite disturbing to see that the person we believe to be behind all this,
posted on his Facebook account, back in August 2014, "Got a great idea for a next
project. Moneymaker. :)" Sure it was, as it managed to raise more than $150k...

**Update**: *Software Enterprise*'s Facebook account is likely to be a fake, maybe a
lure to send us on a wrong track, to a fake name. User *l4v4l4mp3* contacted me to
explain that the posts regarding Zambilight had been created only a few days ago,
then their dates were changed (see the little clock icon next to publication date in
the screenshot below?) to match the beginning of Zambilight's campaign. That might
just be an attempt to orient us towards a fake name.
Also, it is easy to find a Facebook's account unique numeric id, I checked the
nearest ids, and only found accounts created around Feb. 18th 2015.

Many backers also contacted Indiegogo's support obviously, as we would like to get
some help from the people who handled and endorsed it, but it looks like, once more,
Indiegogo does not really care about their users security, but more about the
small percentage they get from any money that's put into an Indiegogo project.
At the moment, the Zambilight project is still up, and still collecting money,
filling *Software Enterprise* and Indiegogo's pockets with money, every time a new
backer gets fooled...

The lesson I'll take from all that is that Indiegogo is clearly not a safe platform
for people willing to back interesting crowd-funding projects. And knowing that, I
think that people who have interesting and real ideas should also avoid the
platform, and grant their backers the safety they deserve, by using safer popular
platforms, such as [KickStarter][kickstarter].

If you want to know more about this, or have precise questions, feel free to
contact me and I'll try to reply as precisely as I can.
There's also a lot of personal information that I did not disclose publicly, like
names, addresses, that I could give to the right people.
