Turns out Jekyll has a new major version (4) that is not officially supported by GitHub... ([See this issue.](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/651))

It could be interesting to consider switching to a pure Jekyll with builds running through [GitHub Actions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/) instead of GitHub Pages...

Will have to get back to that later...
