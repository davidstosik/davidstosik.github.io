Being a home owner comes with its new set of tasks.

After letting weed grow for months, it was finally time to give the garden its first trim.

Ichikawa-san, the landscaper/gardener who did all the house's outside work ([プラス　イズ　LDガーデン](https://www.ld-garden.jp/), "Plus Is LD Garden"?) offered to lend me an electric grass cutter, so I could get a feel of the task and result before I start buying my own tools or even decide what to do with the garden itself (as-is, grass, artificial, ...?).

This morning, I woke up motivated, the sun was out, not too hot, nor too cold, so I put on some podcasts in my ears, boots, gloves, safety glasses, and got started.

I've lived all my adult life in an apartment, up until 2 months ago, so this was the first time I do any kind of yard work since I was a teenager helping my dad.

This did not felt easy, I was not sure whether I was holding the machine right, or doing the right movements, but I got through it.

Now that I'm done and showered, I can say that I kinda liked it. The result looks decent to me (sure, there's still a lot of work to make it look _good_), it felt rewarding, and I kind of enjoyed the mindless activity while listening to podcasts.

Now I'm gonna need a rake, to collect the smaller weeds that I did not gather by hand, as well as to remove a huge amount of rocks!

To be continued...

Update: I bought a rake and spent an our on Monday morning before work to get this. I'm amazed at the amount of rocks we have in there, and I still left a lot behind, but this is looking good.
