Some days ago, we celebrated Amélie's 200th day!

That's more than 6 months! Half a year!

It's incredible how time has flown by, and how less I've done than I was hoping I would do.

When people say having a baby changes your life, they're not kidding!

Anyway, I wanted to take the opportunity given by this checkpoint to look back at the past 6 months, and what we've been through.

About 6 months ago, Amélie, Yuko and I were leaving the hospital to start our new life as a family of three.

## First few days
