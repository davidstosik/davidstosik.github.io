We had a few guests today, and Yuko wanted to have Boursin (they sell it in Japan!) and crackers on the table. We were however unsure whether she was allowed it while pregnant (probably, but "cheese" is a gray area).

I attempted to make a substitute myself, using Japanese cottage cheese, which is safe for her. (All Japanese cheeses are pasteurized, plus cottage cheese is... _not cheese_?)

We were surprised how good this substitute is, for how easy to make it is.
Getting to the point (I wouldn't want my blog to become one of those sites where recipes are hidden after endless stories), here's the recipe:

- cottage cheese (I used the "smooth" type, not the "grainy" one)
- green onions (called konegi - 小ネギ - in Japanese) ; in France I would use ciboulette, obviously
- parsley
- garlic
- black pepper
- salt (only to adjust, as cottage cheese is usually salted)

1. Mince parsley and green onions very finely. (I recommend you use a kitchen knife if you're comfortable with one, as any motorized accessory would probably produce a mush).
2. Grate some garlic cloves. (You might also be able to use a garlic press.)
3. Mix all ingredients together, add some black pepper to taste.
4. Taste and adjust salt.
5. Enjoy on crackers or on bread. I heard it's even better after spending a night in the fridge. We'll see tomorrow!

I didn't write quantities, because I didn't measure myself. Adjust to your taste.

Too strong? Just add more cottage cheese. Too bland? Add more herbs!

For a start, avoid using too much garlic. Its raw tase is quite powerful. I only used a clove and a half for 200g of cottage cheese.

This recipe is so obvious and simple that I'm surprised I didn't think of it sooner!

This was the opportunity for me to explain to Yuko Boursin's slogan: _Du pain, du vin, du Boursin_, which rhymes and means "Some bread, some wine, some Boursin".
Boursin came up with it in 1972, and I would say that it is almost a part of France's modern culture. We had another cracker watching some of Boursin's old ads. Nostlagic to me, and I'm sure a bit puzzling to Yuko.
